### AutoBus Complete

**Overview:**
AutoBus Complete is an engaging and educational word game designed to test players' quick thinking and vocabulary skills. Developed using C# and Windows Forms, the game challenges players to come up with words in various categories that all start with a randomly chosen letter. It's a fun way to learn and improve language skills while enjoying a competitive and timed environment.

**Gameplay:**
In AutoBus Complete, players participate in multiple rounds where they must fill in words for four different categories: Person Name, Animal, Plant, and Country. The twist? All words must begin with a randomly selected letter provided at the start of each round. Players must think quickly and type their answers before the timer runs out.

**Game Rules:**
1. **Rounds and Timer**: 
    - The game consists of a series of rounds, the number of which is set at the beginning of the game.
    - Each round has a specified time limit, also set at the start of the game, within which players must complete all fields.

2. **Letter Selection**:
    - At the beginning of each round, the game randomly selects a letter.
    - Players must enter words that start with this letter for each of the four categories.

3. **Scoring**:
    - Players earn points for each correctly filled field. The default score is 10 points per correct answer.
    - If a player completes all fields correctly, they receive the total score for that round.
    - Points are tallied and displayed on the screen.

4. **Validation**:
    - The game checks each entered word to ensure it starts with the given letter.
    - If a word does not start with the correct letter, an error message is displayed, and the player is prompted to correct it.

5. **End of Game**:
    - The game ends after the set number of rounds.
    - A results screen displays the total points accumulated throughout the game.
